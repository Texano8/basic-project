*Adactin Hotel Management Application.*

Test Automation using Selenium WebDriver, is the latest book released on Selenium 2.0 using Java as a programming language. This Selenium book has been designed with the objectives of simplicity and ease of understanding.

After huge success of author Navneesh Garg’s first book (Test Automation using Unified Functional Testing) this book follows a similar step by step approach to Install, configure and design automation framework using Selenium WebDriver and it components.

This book is recommended both for those who are beginning to learn test automation (using Selenium WebDriver) and for advanced automation users. It follows a unique training based approach instead of a regular text book approach. Using a step by step approach, it guides the students through the exercises using pictorial snapshots.

It includes many practical examples and issues which most of the automation testers encounter in day-to-day automation. These experiences will give you an insight into what challenges you could face with automation in the real world. Practical examples cover how to use most of the features within Selenium WebDriver.
